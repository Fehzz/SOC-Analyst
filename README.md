# SOC-Analyst

# Building an automatic system to be used by the SOC manager.
# The Script will allow the administrator to choose different three types of attacks.
# Active Scanning of the LAN Network is done via Nmap to determine targets available that can be selected by the user. 
# The 3 attacks in this script are:

# Hping3: DoS
# Hydra: Brute-Force
# SMB Enumeration: Server Message Block protocol

# A log is created in /var/log to record the type of attack, the target and the time of execution.
